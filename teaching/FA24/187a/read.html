<h1 id="reading-assignments">Reading Assignments</h1>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>These instructions are a little long, but <em>please read them
carefully</em>. It is your responsibility to know what’s written here to
ensure that you receive credit!</p>
<p>Reading Assignments (RAs) are labeled by a week number and a day,
and will be focused on the assigned reading for that day, as posted in the
<a href="index#schedule">schedule</a>. 
For example, the first one is labeled “w1mon,” which is short for “Week 1
Monday,” and it will cover sections 2.2 and 2.3 from the <a
href="https://sagrawalx.github.io/crypt/">notes</a>. 
<strong> There are two reading assignments due each week, one on Monday 
and one on Wednesday,</strong> which are due at 9:00am PT on the listed day.
The only exceptions are that there are no RAs on Monday in week 7, and 
Wednesday in week 10. </p>
<p>In order to complete your RA, you need to do two things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Attempt to internalize the content of the indicated sections.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In other words, read through the indicated sections in the <a
href="https://sagrawalx.github.io/crypt/">notes</a> and attempt some of the 
exercises included there.</p></li>
<li><p>We’ll discuss this content in class <em>after the RA
deadline</em>. Until then, you’re encouraged to chat with your
classmates and to supplement with any other resources. (Doing that is
part of <a href="syllabus#philosophy">the point</a>!)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Post a “Reading Question” (RQ) to our class <a
href="https://187a-fa2024.zulipchat.com/">Zulip stream</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The reading question must be posted in a stream in the discussion channel on Zulipl
If the reading question is in a different channel, the bot will not tally it and you will
not get credit. </p>
<li><p>The “topic” of a message that’s intended to be an RQ
<em>must</em> contain a label matching the regex
<code>\[w(\d+)(mon|wed)\]</code>, followed by something indicating what
your RQ is about. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your RQ for Week 1 monday is about exercise 2.3.1, you might
make the topic <code>[w1mon] exercise 2.3.1</code>.</li>
<li>If your RQ for Week 1 Monday is about the masonic cipher, you
might make the topic <code>[w1mon] masonic cipher</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re starting a new topic for your RQ, make sure to follow these
rules!</p>
<p>If your RQ is a response in an existing topic that already contains a
valid label, no further action is required on your part: your response
will automatically count under the same label also.</p>
<p>If you notice that a topic is mislabeled, you can <a
href="https://zulip.com/help/rename-a-topic">rename the topic</a> to
correct it.</p></li>
<li><p>Your RQ message should show <em>sincere engagement</em> with the
relevant list of core ideas. Here is a non-exhaustive list of examples
of such things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asking a question about something relevant that you found confusing
or intriguing.</li>
<li>Asking a question about, or sharing a possible solution to, one of
the exercises in the indicated sections.</li>
<li>Asking a question about, or sharing something about, how to use
software to do relevant computations.</li>
<li>Responding to a relevant question that someone else posted.</li>
<li>Sharing something relevant that you found confusing at first, but
then managed to figure out.</li>
<li>Summarizing the key ideas in the reading in your own words.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can <a
href="https://zulip.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown#latex">typeset
math</a>, <a href="https://zulip.com/help/share-and-upload-files">upload
images</a>, and <a
href="https://zulip.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown#code">share
code</a> in Zulip messages.</p>
<p>If your RQ is a question, formulate as <em>precise</em> a question as
you can. For example, if you’re asking about an exercise, say more than
just “I don’t know how to do this exercise.” Instead, share something
specific about what you tried and possibly also what went
wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Questions that are not about the ideas in the relevant section
(eg, about class logistics) are very welcome on Zulip, but they
shouldn’t carry the square-bracket RQ labels. If I react to your
proposed RQ with an octopus emoji, it means your proposed RQ doesn’t
demonstrate sincere engagement and won’t count for credit as an
RQ.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="scoring">Scoring the Reading Assignments</h2>
<li> You get 1 point on a Reading Assignment for
which you post a valid Reading Question on time, up to a maximum of
<span class="math inline">\(n-4\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the total number of RAs.  </li>
<li><p>A <em>very strict</em> bot will tabulate credit for RQs. For
example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you don’t follow the topic labeling instructions above
<em> precisely</em>, the bot might not recognize your post as an RQ and you won’t
get credit for it.</p></li>
<li><p>If you post even <em>one second</em> after the deadline, the bot
will mark it late and you won’t get credit for it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Instructions for checking your RQ score with the bot will be made
available on our Zulip stream.</p></li>
